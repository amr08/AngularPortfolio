<p class="lead">In February of 2016, I embarked on a journey to change careers from the counseling profession to web development. As a self-taught coder, I worked independently for 5 months taking a combination of in-person classes with the group Girl Develop It (a group organized to promote women in technology), attended workshops, and completed online classes. Once I had my son that May, I knew I needed to be fully immersed into coding (outside of the house) if I were to ever become proficient in JavaScript and beyond. This is when I entered into the University of North Carolina&#39;s Full-Stack Web Development program and never looked back! I love what I do and look forward to continuing the expansion of my knowledge and experience.  Please feel free to take a look at my projects as well as <span id="p2detail">stalk</span> browse through my dev footprint on GitHub and résumé on LinkedIn.</p>
